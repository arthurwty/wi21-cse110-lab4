#### 1.
there will be an error since var i is declared inside the for loop so that it is only visible inside the block.

#### 2.
there will be an error since var i is declared inside the for loop so that it is only visible inside the block.

#### 3.
the result of var finalPrice after running the for loop will be printed since finalPrice is declared inside the function.

#### 4.
it will return a array with elements 50, 100, 150. the for loop will calculate finalPrice based on each element from the input array and add the result to the output array.

#### 11.
the result of var finalPrice after running the for loop will be printed since finalPrice is declared inside the function.

#### 12.
it will return an empty array since discounted is const which does not change.

- student.name
- student.'Grad Year'
- student.greeting();
- student.'Favorite Teacher'.name
- student.courseLoad[0]

== compares two variables without considering their datatype. === compares two variables and return true only if the two variables has the same datatype and values

#### 17.
Goodbye. in the first condition, it return false since 2 != true, and same as the second condition.

#### 19.
we iterate the input array in the for loop, each time we call callback function, which is dosomething with parameter(array[i] and another function. the input function will have the input value x mutilpyied by 2, and dosomething will call this input function with the parameter array[i] + 2. Therefore, 2*(array[i]+2) will be added into the newArr each time we iterate in the for loop. And the final answer would be [6,8,10]
